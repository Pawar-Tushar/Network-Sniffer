# SecureNet Analyzer

**SecureNet Analyzer** is a powerful Python-based network traffic monitoring and security tool designed for network administrators, cybersecurity professionals, and penetration testers. This tool provides real-time packet capture, live host detection, vulnerability analysis, and secure user authentication to ensure robust network security.

---

## Overview

**SecureNet Analyzer** captures and analyzes network traffic, detects live devices on the network, and helps identify potential vulnerabilities and threats. Leveraging the **Scapy** library for packet crafting, it offers real-time packet analysis, live host detection using ARP requests, custom packet creation, and secure user authentication with SHA-256 hashing for login security.

The tool is ideal for network monitoring, device enumeration, and testing the resilience of your network against various cyber threats.
